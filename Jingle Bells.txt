Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
The bells on bob-tail ring,
They make our spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight, O

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
